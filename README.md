# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to create my own personal portfolio that showcases my work as a developer, using Bootstrap. I made it similar to the previous portfolio project in layout, going for a more simple and straightforward design.

## Background

Creating a portfolio that showcases your past projects as a web developer is important, as it showcases your abilities to  potential future employers. This project familiarised me to working with Bootstrap.

## Usage

The portfolio consists of a single page, with 2 main sections - "Projects" and "Skills". There is also a footer with links to contact me and find my online presence. The header contains clickable navigation buttons that bring you to each section.
The "Projects" section contains clickable boxes that open projects deployed in Github pages. Please note, only 2 projects are completed thus far, and the other images will be changed to display future projects as I complete them. 

## Creation Process

I tried to use Bootstrap components as much as possible, in order to familiarise myself with Bootstrap's functionality:

For the top-bar navigation, I used Bootstrap's own example navigation bar, editing it to suit my needs. The buttons lead to appropriate sections of the page, with the "resume" and my name (which is clickable), leading to my CV.

The hero section was done using a Jumbotron component as a base.

The rest of the site is laid out using Bootstrap's row and column functionality - a column occupying left 20% of the space for the titles and right column occupying 80% of the space for the content.

Within the "projects" section, I used Bootstrap's "card" components to display images and text within. I laid these cards out using columns,to display in a roughly 2x2 grid.

In the "skills" section, I outlined the 3 main skills i expect to learn in the bootcamp - HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also added an about me section on the same row as per design instructions of the project. I laid out these 4 sections, in a row and styled them. I made the "about me" section more prominent, giving it more space using Bootstrap column options and giving it a different colour pallete.

Finally, I made a footer consisting of interactive buttons leading to external websites and my email. I used Bootstrap functionality to add different colours to each button.

I also used some custom CSS in combination with Bootstrap, to change the colour of some text, image sizes and positiong, as well as to give a hover/shadow effect to every button, which includes navigation, footer and projects.

Additionally, the web-page is dynamic and responsive to different screen sizes. Thanks to Bootstrap's built-in page layout options, the various elements will look correct on various screen sizes.

## Acknowledgements
